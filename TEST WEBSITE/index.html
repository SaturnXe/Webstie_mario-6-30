<p>The Goombas (/Àà…°uÀêmb…ô/), known in Japan as Kurib≈ç,[a] and originally Little Goomba, are a fictional species from Nintendo's Mario franchise. They first appeared in the NES video game Super Mario Bros. as the first enemy players encounter, part of Bowser's Army. They have appeared outside video games, including in film and television. They are usually brownish with long black eyebrows, sharp upward fangs, tan torsos, dark brown feet, and are most commonly seen walking around aimlessly, often as an obstacle, in video games. They were included late in the development of Super Mario Bros. as a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy.</p>
<hr>
<p>The species is considered one of the most iconic elements of the Super Mario series, appearing in nearly every game in the series, and is often ranked amongst the most famous enemies in video games. In 2009, CraveOnline described it as the series' "everyman". The video game incarnation has been made into several plush toys.</p>

<p>Luigi (JP) is Mario's younger, taller, and thinner twin brother. He made his debut in the Game & Watch game Mario Bros., subsequently appearing in the original arcade game Mario Bros. game as the second player. Since then, he, alongside his older twin brother Mario, have been considered the major mascots of Nintendo. He and Mario are Nintendo's most successful video game characters.
<hr>
<p>He has also appeared in the Mario Kart series, the Super Smash Bros. series, and the Mario Party series. After Nintendo decided to move Luigi out of being nothing more than a palette swap of Mario since his first appearance, he has gained his own personality and lifestyle, earning him appearances in his very own games, Mario is Missing! and the widely popular Luigi's Mansion series as the central character instead of Mario.

<p>Bowser („ÇØ„ÉÉ„Éë, Kuppa, "Koopa"),[6] also known as King Bowser or King Koopa, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Nintendo's Mario franchise. In Japan, his title is Daima≈ç (Â§ßÈ≠îÁéã, "Great Demon King").[7] He is the arch-nemesis of the plumber Mario, and the leader of the turtle-like Koopa race. Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance with dragon-like elements, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, and tyrannical personality. His ultimate goals are to kidnap Princess Peach, make her his queen, and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, and eventually the world.
<hr>
<p>Bowser debuted as Mario's opponent in the 1985 video game Super Mario Bros. Designer Shigeru Miyamoto had first conceived an ox based on the Ox-King from the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great, but Takashi Tezuka remarked that the character looked more like a turtle than an ox, and the two collaborated to refine Bowser's appearance into the leader of the turtle-like Koopas. Bowser's voice actor is Kenneth W. James. His previous voice actors include Scott Burns, who voiced Bowser's first dialogue in a video game, and Eric Newsome, who voiced him in
